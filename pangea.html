    <h1>Difference Between Modern Earth and Pangea</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Modern Earth is very different from how the planet looked millions of years ago.
            Today, Earth is divided into multiple continents such as Africa, Asia, Europe,
            North America, South America, Australia, and Antarctica. These continents are
            separated by vast oceans including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and
            Southern oceans.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, during the time of Pangea, all continents were united into a single
            massive landmass. There were no separate continents as we know them today. Instead,
            Earth had only one supercontinent surrounded by a single enormous ocean known as
            the <strong>Tethys Ocean</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because everything was connected in Pangea, climates, ecosystems, and animal
            migration were very different. Species could travel across the land without
            needing to cross oceans, which explains why similar fossils have been found on
            continents that are now far apart.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over millions of years, tectonic plate movement caused Pangea to slowly break apart.
            This process formed the continents and oceans we see today, shaping Earth's modern
            geography and influencing climate, biodiversity, and human civilization.
