    <h1>Mesoamerican Civilizations</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Olmecs</h2>
        <p>
            The Olmecs are considered the first great Mesoamerican civilization. They lived along the Gulf Coast
            of present-day Mexico, mainly in the regions of Veracruz and Tabasco. Their civilization developed
            around 1200 BCE and is famous for the colossal stone heads they carved.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Olmecs had advanced knowledge of agriculture, growing crops such as maize, beans, and squash.
            They also developed early forms of writing, religious rituals, and complex social structures that
            influenced later civilizations.

        <h2>Mayans</h2>
        <p>
            The Maya civilization lived in southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador.
            They are known for their impressive cities, pyramids, and temples built in the rainforest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Maya made major advances in mathematics, astronomy, and writing. They created a complex calendar
            system and used a base-20 number system, including the concept of zero. Their society was deeply
            connected to religion and the observation of the stars.

        <h2>Aztecs</h2>
        <p>
            The Aztec civilization lived in central Mexico and built their capital city, Tenochtitlán, on a lake.
            This city later became Mexico City. The Aztecs formed a powerful empire through conquest and alliances.
        </p>
        <p>
            They were skilled engineers and farmers, creating chinampas (floating gardens) to grow food.
            The Aztecs had a strong military, a rich mythology, and complex religious ceremonies.
